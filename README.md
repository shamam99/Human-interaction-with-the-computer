Virtual Reality is  coming to Xbox

This project is a research that we worked on as an integrated team to find the reasons why people decline to buy Sony virtual reality devices and compare them to Xbox.
Integrated references for people's opinions on this topic were also provided.
In the end, a complete business model was developed as a proposal to Microsoft in case they wanted to start developing a virtual reality device.
taking into account the designs that we attached with the improvements and features that were modified based on market demand.
